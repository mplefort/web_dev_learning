            <h1>Welcome:</h1>
            <p>
                I am a Mechanical Engineer with a passion for controls, robotics, and automation. I grew up in southern
                California where I developed a mechanical skill set as a motorcycle mechanic in highschool and followed
                my interests in engineering at UC Davis. I grew as an undergraduate to find my calling in controls and
                robotics and developed a control architecture using the ROS framework for a mobile robot. Upon finishing
                school, I joined the engineering firm Altec to gain a perspective of real world design and manufacturing
                at a production level.

                My current path has lead me to look for a small firm seeking a product development engineer to aid in
                electro-mechanical design of a product that needs to be taken from the drawing board to the production
                line. My skill set in mechanics, electronics, and software make me a well rounded individual ready to
                tackle any problem.

            <p>
                <em>Software Engineer </em> at Pluk Robotics LLC
                <br>
                Pluk robotics is a small company focused on the task of creating an autonomous mushroom harvesting
                device for industrial farms. My work has including design, troubleshooting, and development of software,
                hardware, and machined components to reach our company's design goals. Some of the key features and
                projects of my work are:

                - Using the ROS framework I developed the implementation of Moveit (Inverse kinematic solver and motion
                planner) for smooth, fast, and repeatable motion plans on a custom designed robotic arm.

                - Adding robust software in C++/Python to reduce the chances of software crashes and automatic restart
                in the case of an executable failing.

                - My current development project is to implement a CNN machine learning network capable of predicting
                mushroom poses using RGBD imaging. This process includes developing and efficiently annotating a large
                dataset, evaluating various networks designed using the Keras/Tensorflow libraries and implementing a
                real-time capable system on the Jetson TX2 using tensorRT. More to come as development continues.

                Examples of these features in a video format to come.
